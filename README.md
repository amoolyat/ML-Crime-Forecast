# ML-Crime-Forecast

Crime forecasting improves public safety and develops effective law enforcement strategies. By understanding crime patterns and predicting future trends, authorities can better allocate resources, staff, and preventive measures. This proactive approach can reduce crime rates and lessen its impact on communities. This project addresses the challenge of predicting crime rates across the top crime-affected boroughs in London, using historical crime data from 2016 to 2022.

The main objective of this project is to use advanced time series forecasting techniques, specifically ARIMA and LSTM, to model crime trends in Londonâ€™s most crime-affected boroughs. By comparing these two methods, we aim to highlight the strengths of each in capturing the unique patterns and complexities present in crime data. Ultimately, the goal is to produce reliable predictions that enhance crime prevention strategies and improve resource management.
